Description: This package provides various functions to partition the phenotypic variance of a plastic trait, studied through its reaction norm. The variance partition distinguishes between the variance arising from the average shape of the reaction norms (V_Plas) and the (additive) genetic variance . The latter is itself separated into an environment-blind component (V_G/V_A) and the component arising from plasticity (V_GxE/V_AxE). The package also provides a way to further partition V_Plas into aspects (slope/curvature) of the shape of the average reaction norm (π-decomposition) and partition V_Add (γ-decomposition) and V_AxE (ι-decomposition) into the impact of genetic variation in the reaction norm parameters.
